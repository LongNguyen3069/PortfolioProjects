📦 Amazon Sales & Reviews SQL Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an Amazon Sales and Reviews dataset using SQL Server (T-SQL) to uncover insights related to product pricing, customer ratings, and sentiment trends across brands.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world SQL skills such as data exploration, aggregation, joins, window functions, CTEs, temp tables, and view creation — while producing analysis-ready outputs for Tableau visualizations.

🚀 How to Run This Project

Import the dataset into SQL Server

Ensure both tables are in the same database (AmazonProject)

Run the SQL script sequentially in SSMS

Connect Tableau to SQL Server or created views

Build dashboards using the provided queries

📌 Key Takeaways

Brands with extreme ratings (1⭐ or 5⭐) show clear sentiment patterns

Heavy discounting does not always correlate with higher ratings

Sentiment analysis helps identify product improvement opportunities

Window functions and views greatly simplify BI workflows
